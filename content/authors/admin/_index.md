I am Sunil Christian, though feel free to call me Sunny if that is easier for youâ€¦ I am a student at Indiana University in Bloomington with academic passions surrounding Informatics, Business, and Political/Civil Engagement. While pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Informatics, I paired my love for technology with interests in business and public service into my academia by declaring a minor in Business and a minor in Leaders and Leadership (from IU's Political And Civil Engagement program). At the forefront of my goals, I hope to use my time at Indiana University to cultivate interdisciplinary skills which will be invaluable in any organizational space. With a particular passion for social progress and experience in organizations in the non-profit industry, I hope to pursue career opportunities in industries which share my values and my passion for empowering people... whether these opportunities be in the healthcare industry, the academic sector, a non-profit organization, or merely any firm with a strong sense of purpose, mission, values, and culture. I am proud to have developed experience within organizations which embody these values, particularly with my time volunteering with the Digital Events Management Team for the 2020 Bernie Sanders national campaign and when interning for a non-profit, The Borgen Project.
